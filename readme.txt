== Description ==

The Recipe Template plugin makes it quick and easy for you to add recipes to your blog.

You can personalise the colours, heading descriptions and layout.

Your visitors will be able to:

* Print just the recipe (not the whole blog post, which might be several pages)
* Click on photographs to see a larger version
* Filter and search for recipes (requires an optional link to [GetMeCooking](http://www.getmecooking.com))
 
A video overview and more information is [available here](http://www.getmecooking.com/recipe-template)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the layout of the recipe? =

Yes, there are simple options to customise many aspects of the recipe. Don't like the recipe step photo on the right? POW! One click and it's on the left.

= Can visitors print just the recipe? =

They sure can, each recipe has its own print link.

= Does this plugin take care of Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)? =

Don't worry about the search engine bots, we speak their language.

= So how do I use your plugin? =

Come sit closer little Timmy, [I'll tell you all about it](http://www.getmecooking.com/recipe-template-info#how-to-use).

= Do I need to type in ALL the information? =

Everything is optional and headings will only appear if you have typed in the relevant information. If you want the recipe to appear on GetMeCooking then we do need a photo of the finished recipe.
