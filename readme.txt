== Description ==

The Recipe Template plugin makes it quick and easy for you to:

* Add many recipes to a blog post, or the same recipe in many posts
* Specify if the recipe is relevant for food allergies and intolerances
* Personalise the colours, heading descriptions and layout of recipes
* Search Engine Optimised

Your visitors will be able to:

* Print just the recipe, not the whole blog post. Choose with all photos, just main photo or just text
* Click on photographs to see larger versions
* Filter and search for recipes (requires an optional link to [GetMeCooking](http://www.getmecooking.com))

The premium version gives you more features:

* Recipe index page - list all of your recipes on any page or blog post with a choice of different layout options
* Show recipes by category - display a list of categories (allergies, courses, etc.) on any page or blog post. Click on a category to display a list of relevant recipes
* Display fresh content - display up to 10 of your your most recently added recipes on any page or blog post
* Advanced management - see which recipes you have added to a blog post, multiple blog posts, or not yet added
* In-blog linking of recipes - recipes link to posts on your blog instead of linking to [GetMeCooking](http://www.getmecooking.com)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the layout of the recipe? =

Yes, there are simple options to customise many aspects of the recipe. Don't like the recipe step photo on the right? POW! One click and it's on the left.

= Can visitors print just the recipe? =

They sure can, each recipe has its own print link. Print just the recipe, not the whole blog post. Choose with all photos, just main photo or just text.

= Does this plugin take care of Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)? =

Don't worry about the search engine bots, we speak their language.

= Can I add more than 1 recipe to a blog post? =

Yes. You can add as many recipes as you like. An example of this being useful is if your child has attended a school fete and you have cooked more than one recipe

= Can the same recipe exist on more than one blog post? =

Yes. And if you make changes to the recipe, the changes will be updated in all of your blog posts

= Can I edit recipes after I have posted them on my blog? =

Yes - just edit the recipe. No need to do anything in the blog post

= Do I need to type in ALL the information? =

Everything is optional and headings will only appear if you have typed in the relevant information. If you want the recipe to appear on GetMeCooking then we do need a photo of the finished recipe.

= So how do I use your plugin? =
